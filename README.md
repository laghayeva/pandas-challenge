# pandas-challenge

In this challenge, I analyzed school performance metrics using pandas and dataframes. The code presented is entirely my own, with the exception of the sections that utilize code provided in the starter file for our use. Analysis summary and observations are provided below and also included in the jupyter notebook as a markdown at the end of the notebook.

# Analysis Summary:

This analysis evaluates school performance metrics, including average math and reading scores, passing rates, and the influence of factors such as school type, size, and spending. Key findings suggest that charter schools outperform district schools across all metrics, while medium-sized schools generally exhibit the highest performance levels. The data also indicates that school size significantly impacts performance, whereas budgets and per capita spending appear to have little correlation with overall success. Further investigation is needed to confirm these trends and explore additional factors influencing school performance.

# Observations:

On average, charter schools have higher overall math and reading scores than district schools. The overall passing rate for charter schools is nearly double that of district schools.
Large schools tend to perform worse compared to medium and small-sized schools. While medium and small schools perform similarly in general, small schools show slightly higher average math and reading scores. However, their percentages for passing math, reading, and overall passing are lower than those of medium-sized schools. This suggests that the average scores for small schools may be skewed to the right due to outliers or exceptional performances.
Based on the top- and bottom-performing schools summary, it appears that school budgets and per capita spending do not strongly correlate with overall performance. Some of the lowest-performing schools have higher budgets and per capita spending than higher-performing schools. However, further analysis is required to confirm this hypothesis, as the current data may not be sufficient for a definitive conclusion. What does seem to have a clearer impact on performance is school size, as suggested by the top- and bottom-performing schools summary data as well as the school size summary data.
